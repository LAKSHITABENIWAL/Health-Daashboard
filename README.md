National Health Dashboard - Power BI Project
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of national healthcare trends, patient demographics, and treatment costs. The dashboard is designed to support data-driven decisions for healthcare providers, policymakers, and hospital administrators.

1. 📌 Business Problem
The healthcare industry faces challenges related to resource allocation, cost management, and improving patient outcomes. Hospitals need an efficient way to monitor patient trends, treatment effectiveness, and financial performance. This project addresses the need for:

Identifying patient admission patterns and health condition prevalence

Monitoring resource usage (doctors, bedspace, rooms)

Evaluating treatment outcomes by condition and hospital

Analyzing billing trends and insurance provider performance

2. 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
The goal of this dashboard is to present a dynamic, interactive health report that enables stakeholders to:

Visualize patient demographics and key performance metrics over time

Explore trends based on medical conditions, hospitals, and year

Understand cost drivers and average billing amounts

Gain operational insights to optimize resource planning and patient care strategies

3. 📊 Walkthrough of Key Visuals
🧍‍♂️ Patients Demographics Tab
Summary Cards: Display admitted patients, doctors, rooms, average billing, length of stay (LOS), and patient age.

Condition-Based Segmentation: Users can filter by medical condition (e.g., Asthma) to get a detailed overview, including test results and gender breakdown.

Hospital Comparison Table: Shows patient count by condition across major U.S. hospitals like Johns Hopkins, Mayo, and UCLA.

Bar Charts: Display condition prevalence across genders.

📈 Key Trends Tab
Trend Analysis: Line charts track average length of stay based on admission type (elective, emergency, urgent) throughout the year.

Admissions Heatmap: Monthly and daily patterns of patient admissions provide granular temporal insights.

Donut Charts: Visualize proportional distributions of hospital resource utilization and patient results.

💰 Treatment & Cost Tab
Billing by Stay Duration: Bar charts break down treatment costs by Length of Stay (LOS) buckets and admission type.

Insurance Analysis: Billing distribution across Medicare, Aetna, Cigna, etc.

Medication Summary: Table showing medicine usage (e.g., Aspirin, Ibuprofen) by condition—highlighting total counts and usage patterns.

4. 🔍 Key Insights
Asthma has a relatively low patient count but shows 100% abnormal test results, highlighting a potential public health concern.

Diabetes, Hypertension, and Obesity are the most prevalent conditions, requiring more resource allocation.

Houston Methodist and Johns Hopkins report high volumes for critical conditions like cancer and diabetes.

Extended stays (15+ days) account for the highest billing, especially for urgent cases—signifying more complex treatments.

Medicare and UnitedHealthCare are the primary insurance payers, with Medicare contributing the highest billing amounts.

Gender-based Analysis shows a higher prevalence of chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension in females.
